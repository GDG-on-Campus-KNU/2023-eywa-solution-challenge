  "summary": "Humulus japonicus, known as Japanese hop, is an ornamental plant in the family Cannabaceae. Some authorities have it as a synonym of Humulus scandens.Originally native to East Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea, and extending its habitat to Vietnam, it was imported to North America in the late 19th century as an ornamental. Since its arrival in North America, it has spread widely. It can be found throughout the Northeastern U.S. and eastern Canada, and considered an invasive species in North America. It also features on the list of invasive alien species of Union Concern since 2019. This means it can no longer be imported in the European Union. Additionally, it has become illegal to plant it, breed it, transport it, or bring it into the wild in all Member States.",
