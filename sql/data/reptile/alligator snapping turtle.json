		"ecosystem": "Care should be taken when handling it as it has an aggressive nature and can cause serious injury to people using its strong jaws. Predatory activities of the introduced species in Japan have reduced the populations of native aquatic species, competed for food with native turtles, and have been reported to bite people. Its powerful jaws are so powerful that it can cause severe injuries when bitten. In Bavaria, Germany, there have been cases where an individual introduced into the wild has injured a child.",
